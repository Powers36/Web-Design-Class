            <h2>The Four-Stroke Cycle: A Symphony of Motion</h2>
            <p>
                At its core, a car engine is a heat engine that converts chemical energy from fuel into mechanical motion. Most modern gasoline engines operate on a <strong>four-stroke cycle</strong>, a process that is repeated hundreds of times a minute to power the vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>
                This cycle consists of four distinct steps: intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust. The precision and timing of these steps are <em>critical</em> for the engine to run smoothly and efficiently.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"The four-stroke engine is a testament to human ingenuity, a perfect blend of physics and engineering."</p>
                <cite>â€” Karl Benz, automotive pioneer</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                The process begins with the <strong>Intake Stroke</strong>, where the piston moves down, pulling in a mixture of air and fuel. Next, during the <strong>Compression Stroke</strong>, the piston moves back up, squeezing this mixture into a tiny space. This compression dramatically increases the pressure and temperature. The third stroke, <strong>Combustion</strong>, is the power stroke. The spark plug ignites the compressed mixture, causing a powerful explosion that forces the piston down with great force. Finally, the <strong>Exhaust Stroke</strong> pushes the spent gases out of the cylinder to make way for the next cycle.
