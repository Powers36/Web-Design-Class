            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
             <p>
                    My name is James Powers, and I'm a Machine Operator at Cardinal Health, where I manufacture electrode patches. 
                My professional experience has been complemented by my ongoing education in web and software development, and I'm also well-versed in mechanical drawings and 3D modeling. 
                I am a versatile and handy person with a passion for building and fixing things, whether it's working on a car or assembling a computer. 
                This blend of hands-on skills and technical knowledge has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and creation.
             <p>
                Outside of work and school, I'm a proud resident of Wabasha, Minnesotaâ€”a town known as the inspiration for the movie Grumpy Old Men and its scenic location on the Mississippi River. 
                I'm a huge fan of Minnesota sports teams, especially the Vikings, and I love taking deep dives into history, particularly the Civil War and WWII. 
                Friends often describe me as a kind and funny person who is always ready to lend a hand, reflecting my strong belief in helping others.

            <h2>My Goals for this Course</h2>
             <p>
                My primary goal for this Web Design, HTML, and CSS class is to gain an in-depth understanding of how to build websites that are not only functional but also creatively designed. 
                I am eager to expand my knowledge of coding and master the various techniques and best practices that professionals use to create seamless and engaging user experiences. 
                By learning the fundamental principles and intricate details of web development, I aim to lay the groundwork for a future career in this dynamic field. 
                I am committed to dedicating the time and effort necessary to grow my skills and create a portfolio that showcases my ability to design and develop high-quality, professional websites.
